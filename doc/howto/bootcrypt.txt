Encrypting the boot drive on Ubuntu:
====================================

These steps (followed carefully) encrypt the boot drive and install the 
Linux Shielded Virtual Machine (LSVM) components. After completing them,
you should be able to reboot into a system with an encrypted boot parition.

(1) Use the 'bootcrypt' script to convert the /boot partition to an
    encrypted parition. Instructions on how to update /etc/crypttab and
    /etc/fstab are printed to standard output.

(2) Build and install LSVM:

    # cd vmshield
    # make
    # make install

(3) Reboot the system and hopefully it will boot from the encrypted drive.

    # reboot
